/**
 * Scan cache with the design doc's fingerprint scheme (§2 缓存与指纹,
 * decision #5/#12, ticket #4).
 *
 * The cache key is the RAW sourcePath plus a per-plugin file-manifest
 * fingerprint:
 *
 *   fingerprint = sha256 over a canonical string built from
 *     - the name list of the root's plugin directories (`git:` copies
 *       excluded — the scanner skips them whole, so they can never move
 *       the scan output and must not be able to move the cache either),
 *     - per plugin: the stat tuple of `.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json`
 *       (the #12 metadata source — editing it invalidates the cache) and
 *       the `(relativePath, mtimeMs, size)` tuples of every non-dot entry
 *       under `agents/ skills/ rules/ avatars/` down to depth 3 — entries
 *       INCLUDE directories themselves (decision #20: a skills/
 *       subdirectory with no files still changes the scan output, so a
 *       files-only manifest could miss).
 *
 * `GET /api/state` computes that stat-only fingerprint on every request
 * (hundreds of stats on the real corpus, milliseconds — never a content
 * read) and rescans only when it moved. This is exactly the granularity
 * decision #5 anchors: editing an existing agent file, or adding one
 * inside an existing plugin's `agents/`, leaves every top-level directory
 * mtime untouched — a top-level `(name, mtimeMs)` key would miss both.
 *
 * Deliberate blind spots (stat tuples, not content hashes — the design
 * doc's exact key): a rewrite that preserves size AND restores mtime
 * (copy tools that keep timestamps) is invisible until `POST /api/refresh`
 * force-drops the cache, and README.md is outside the key exactly as §2's
 * recipe lists (a README-only edit surfaces after refresh; the same
 * "invisible until refresh" philosophy the install manifest settled in #8
 * for its own fingerprint). Refresh is the disclosed fallback for all of
 * these — which is why invalidate() must truly force a fresh scan even
 * when one is already in flight (see the epoch gate below).
 *
 * The scanner itself stays a pure function with no fingerprinting — the
 * comparison lives here, in the service layer.
